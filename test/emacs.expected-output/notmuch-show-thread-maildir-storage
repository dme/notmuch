I saw the LWN article and decided to take a look at notmuch.  I'm
currently using mutt and mairix to index and read a collection of
Maildir mail folders (around 40,000 messages total).

notmuch indexed the messages without complaint, but my attempt at
searching bombed out. Running, for example:

  notmuch search storage

Resulted in 4604 lines of errors along the lines of:

  Error opening
  /home/lars/Mail/read-messages.2008/cur/1246413773.24928_27334.hostname,U=3026:2,S:
  Too many open files

I'm curious if this is expected behavior (i.e., notmuch does not work
with Maildir) or if something else is going on.

Cheers,

  Is the list archived anywhere?  The obvious archives
  (http://notmuchmail.org/pipermail/notmuch/) aren't available, and I
  think I subscribed too late to get the patch (I only just saw the
  discussion about it).

  It doesn't look like the patch is in git yet.

   I've also pushed a slightly more complicated (and complete) fix to my
   private notmuch repository

   git://keithp.com/git/notmuch

   > Is the list archived anywhere?

   Oops. Looks like Carl's mail server is broken. He's traveling to
   Barcelona today and so it won't get fixed for a while.

   Thanks to everyone for trying out notmuch!

    The version of lib/messages.cc in your repo doesn't build because it's
    missing "#include <stdint.h>" (for the uint32_t on line 466).

 Welcome, Lars!

 I hadn't even seen that Keith's blog post had been picked up by lwn.net.
 That's very interesting. So, thanks for coming and trying out notmuch.

 Sadly, the lwn article coincided with me having just introduced this
 bug, and then getting on a Trans-Atlantic flight. So I fixed the bug
 fairly quickly, but there was quite a bit of latency before I could push
 the fix out. It should be fixed now.

 Notmuch works just fine with maildir---it's one of the things that it
 likes the best.

 Happy hacking,

 -Carl
